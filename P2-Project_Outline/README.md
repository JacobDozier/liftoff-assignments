## Submission Instructions

### Overview
With all of the different responsibilities placing demands on our time, everyone needs a way to keep organized. For most of us a list of tasks with some intuitive connections to other people, times and topics would suffice. Also, most people will not take the time to open their computer and log in to view their tasks, so their task lists need to be accessible on the go and offline.

Simple task lists are useful, but they become infinitely more useful when you can add context to your tasks(lists). These lists should be able to be shared with your family, friends, coworkers, or anyone else. Some tasks are also time/date sensitive so you should have the availability to attach these things to your tasks. Also, times/dates are really only useful, on the go, if the app pushes you a notification at the correct time/date. As hinted at above, tasks should be organized in lists so you can focus on the work at hand and not be distracted by unrelated tasks.

Research has shown that the way to get people to use software is to put it on a smartphone as an app. A full blown mobile app seems like something that is both outside the current scope of available resources and is not necessary. A web application that keeps track of tasks would be perfect as progressive web app, or PWA. This would give users the ability to view their tasks offline and perhaps to even add new tasks.
